# Simon's Satire
This is a mod module for KTANE (Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes), a popular Steam game. It is a merging of sorts to the variety of Simon and Talk-related modules that exist out there already. The base idea for this mod (and the supplier of the vast majority of creative input and phrases) was done by a friend of mine, while I did the visual design & scripting.

The manual in HTML format can be found here: https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Simon%27s%20Satire.html

Chances are, if you're here, you've already gotten the module through the Steam Workshop and have played it, so there won't be any instructions on how to set it up here. This repository basically only exists for the purpose of having a backup of the project files for myself in case my local copy is corrupted or missing at any point, and to allow people to make pull requests with feature additions/edits.
